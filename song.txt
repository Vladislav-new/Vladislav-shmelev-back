Cre-age-aeon
New beginnings held in infinite vacuum
Biotronic test-worlds free of inscription
Devoid of the echoes of man
Noble cyborg savage
In cold ceremonial perfection
More radiant than the sum of suns
With each and every attribute
Of animal, machine and man
Dystopia Electro-Heart
The grotesque and the linear
Took one final giant blow
Into the Ram of what is us
In cold ceremonial perfection
More radiant than the sun of suns
With each and every attribute
Of animal, machine and man
Installing awaiting the restoration of unsequenced chaos
We've only seen the outlines of the beginning
And this core, the slowly moving raptor
Will make the very notion of Hell
Seem celestial in comparison
